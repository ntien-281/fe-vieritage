# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.
This is extended from react-native-navigation so the latter is no longer necessary.

## 🚀 How to run

```
npm start
```
## ⚙️ Not working? try:
```
npm install --global expo-cli
expo-cli start --tunnel
```
